This page collects files and computer code for the paper **Computing the Distributions of Economic Models via Simulation**
by John Stachurski and Vance Martin.

Abstract
----------

We study a Monte Carlo algorithm for computing marginal and stationary
densities of stochastic models with the Markov property, establishing global
asymptotic normality and :math:`O_P(n^{-1/2})` convergence.  Asymptotic normality
is used to derive error bounds in terms of the distribution of the
norm deviation.
